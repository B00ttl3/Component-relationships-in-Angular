<!-- Parent Child Relationship. So first we have added the app-header as the parent component. we have already made it insdie the header folder and made its selector app-header inside the ts file of that folder, and then now we added that here and same goes with app-navbar. Both of these are the CHILD components, as these are the inner components, and the parent component is this html file which is app.component -->

<app-header></app-header>
<app-navbar></app-navbar>
